        Allows the user to alter the ordering of the ImageTags in the build parameter.

    <div>
        <strong>Natural Ordering</strong> ... same Ordering as the tags had in prior versions<br/>
        <strong>Reverse Natural Ordering</strong> ... the reversed original ordering<br/>
        <strong>Descending Versions</strong> ... attempts to pars the tags to a version and order them descending<br/>
        <strong>Ascending Versions</strong> ... attempts to pars the tags to a version and order them ascending<br/>

        <strong>WARNING:</strong><br/>
        Careful with Versioned sorting, this works best with <a href="https://semver.org/">semver</a> or maven version compliant
        ImageTags, but won't work at all under certain circumstances!<br/>
        The conversion from tags to versions can fail in certain cases and cause the sorting to fail, which will result in an
        empty selection list.<br/>
        In such a case the user will get notified about a parameter misconfiguration.
